Boilerplate React App

This is a React template project, for starting developing new React apps without having to setting up tons of dependencies or defining a folder structure.

It comes with libraries like jQuery, Babel, Foundation, Karma, Mocha, Expect and others. 

You can start writing tests to your components right off the bat after downloading it, because of the test dependencies already included.
